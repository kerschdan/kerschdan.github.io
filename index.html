        <p>Abstract:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-75" style="border: 2px solid;">
        <p>In the early stages of the automotive development process a lot of effort goes into the specification of a consistent set of targets. In this context, a target can be anything from the vehicleâ€™s price to a performance indicator such as top speed. Due to opposing economic and technological ambitions, conflicting vehicle targets are inevitable. This work investigates data-driven models on their potential for supporting the target definition process. The focus is here on vehicle attributes of high relevance to consumers.
            <br>
            Vehicle characteristics that qualify as targets were selected from a database. They act as the supervisor in the respective machine learning problem. The underlying raw data underwent extensive data preparation to meet the requirements of an unbiased, high-quality dataset. Statistical tests were performed to assess the predictive power of single inputs before the multiple regression models were built using a forward selection technique. The output, a mathematical model for predicting a vehicle attribute based on dependent variables, can be further used for calculating all possible solutions. By combining all possible solutions of all models, a solution space could be created that outlines all technological feasible options. This concept was examined with the available models in the sport utility vehicle segment and shows promising results.
